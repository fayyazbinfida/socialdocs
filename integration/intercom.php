          <p><img src="../assets/img/intercom-06.5995627e.png" alt="title"></p>
          <p>The benefits of using Smart ChatBot with intercom is that, your business can automate at least 80% with chatbot
            &amp; A.I. You can easily build your chatbot with our visual flow builder, and if at any point, your
            customer needs any help.</p>
          <p>You can connect with an Action, and then go to Basic Actions, then you can find “Talk to human/Pause
            automation”, and then your customer from 11+ social channels can talk directly to your intercom live chat
            support.</p>
          <p>After your customer initiates a conversation, you will see the new contacts created from social channels
            along with their questions.</p>
          <p>Smart ChatBot will pull the user’s profile, email &amp; phone to create the contact if there is any.</p>
          <p><img src="../assets/img/intercom-07.fa6d5704.png" alt="title"></p>
          <p>And now your intercom agent can talk directly back to the customer from 11+ social channels.</p>
          <p>By default, the live chat is set at 30 mins, after the time passed, if there is no active conversation, the
            user will be sent back to chatbot automation.</p>
          <h3 id="step-2-sending-files-images"><a href="#step-2-sending-files-images" class="header-anchor">#</a> Step
            2: Sending files &amp; Images</h3>
          <p><img src="../assets/img/intercom-08.b5fbcee3.png" alt="title"></p>
          <p>After your customer active live chat from our flow, your customers can send text, images &amp; files to
            your agent.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, your intercom agent can also send images &amp; files back to the user.</p>
          <p>If the intercom agent adds any notes to the customer/conversation, the note content will also sync to
            Smart ChatBot’s subscribers</p>
          <p><img src="../assets/img/intercom-09.e28b6017.png" alt="title"></p>
          <p>Please note that you can also see all the live chat history inside of Smart ChatBot’s live chat.</p>
          <h3 id="step-3-ending-conversation"><a href="#step-3-ending-conversation" class="header-anchor">#</a> Step 3:
            Ending conversation</h3>
          <p>If your intercom live chat support helps the user solve the issue, and when they close the conversation,
            the user will be pushed back to the chatbot automation.</p>
          <p>If intercom live chat decides to follow up on the issue, for certain channels(Messenger, WhatsApp,
            Instagram) if it’s within 24 hours window, we will deliver the message. If it’s out of the 24-hour window,
            we will reply that the user is out of the contact window.</p>
          <p>If the user is within the contact window, any messages from the intercom agent will reset the 30 human
            support window &amp; activate live chat with the user.</p>
